# MT5 Profit/Loss Calculator - System Summary

The MT5 Standalone Profit/Loss Calculator is a comprehensive, read-only reporting tool designed for Windows environments that connects to multiple MetaTrader 5 accounts sequentially to calculate and analyze profit/loss scenarios without any trading functionality. This Python-based system processes open positions and pending orders across configured MT5 accounts with customizable delays between account processing, calculating current unrealized P/L, potential losses if stop-loss levels are hit, and potential profits if take-profit targets are reached. The tool features robust error handling with automatic retry mechanisms, comprehensive logging with configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), flexible output options including both console display and timestamped JSON file generation, position and order data caching for performance optimization, optional magic number filtering for selective analysis, and extensive symbol configuration supporting major forex pairs, cross pairs, precious metals, indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies with accurate dollar-per-lot-per-price-unit calculations. Security is prioritized through credential protection via example configuration templates, .gitignore integration to prevent accidental credential commits, secure file handling for sensitive trading data, and comprehensive validation systems that verify account configurations, MT5 terminal connections, and symbol mappings before processing. The system includes a user-friendly Windows batch file interface with interactive menu options, command-line flexibility with multiple execution modes, detailed troubleshooting capabilities with debug logging, installation validation tools, and maintains compatibility with existing trading systems through consistent function naming conventions while providing professional-grade reporting with account identification, combined totals across multiple accounts, and detailed breakdowns suitable for risk management and portfolio analysis.
